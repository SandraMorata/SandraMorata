# 👩‍💻 Sandra Morata — Data Explorer & AI Apprentice 🤖

Hey there! I'm Sandra — a performance marketing specialist expanding my skills into the world of Data Science & AI.  
After years working with data-rich campaigns and automating workflows, I'm now learning to build more powerful, custom solutions that complement and elevate my strategic background.

🔍 I love uncovering hidden patterns, automating things, and building data-driven solutions.  
📁 My GitHub is a mix of class projects, personal experiments, and practice code in Python, SQL, and backend dev.

I’m currently studying a Master’s in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence, working with:
- 🐍 Python (my favorite challenge!)
- ⚙️ Flask & Django (currently building my personal site)
- 🧮 SQL (tons of queries, and still counting)
- 📊 Power BI (course completed 💪)
- 🧠 Machine Learning, Data Mining & Jupyter (coming soon!)

### 🎯 My goal?
To reduce reliance on costly tools and code smarter ways to improve performance,  
optimize attribution, and automate strategies across platforms like Google Ads.
